What is Flutter?
-> A tool that allows you to build native cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop) application using one programming language and codebase.


What is native?
-> An application developed exclusively for a single platform using a native-to-the-operating-system language is a native app. e.g. Android Studio, XCode etc.


What is Hybrid?
-> A blend solution that consists of both native and web solutions. Developers embed the code written with web development languages (HTML, CSS amd JS) into a native app using Apache Cordova or Iconic's Capacitor. e.g. VS Code, Ionic etc.


What is cross-platform?
-> A cross-platform computer product or system is a product or system that can work across multiple types of platform or operating environments. Cross-platform is also known as multiplatform or platform independent. e.g. Flutter, React Native etc.

Benefits of FLutter?
- Increased Time-to-Market Speed
- Reduced code development Time
- The potential ability to go beyond mobile
- Same UI and Business logic in all platforms
- Custom, animated UI of any complexity available
- Similar to Native app performance
- Own Rendering Engine
- Simple platform specific logic implementation


Flutter Architecture?
-> Whenever we build a flutter application, we kind of build a widget tree because it's all about widgets.
-> Platform Differences
